### Validation Process
1. Search for official docs + production examples
2. Verify with multiple sources (official docs, Stack Overflow, production blogs)
3. Check compatibility with Python 3.12/3.13
4. Validate with type checking (mypy strict)
5. Implement with tests and error handling

## Core Capabilities

### Python 3.12-3.13 Features
- **Performance**: JIT compilation (+11% speed 3.12→3.13, +42% from 3.10), 10-30% memory reduction
- **Free-Threaded CPython**: GIL-free parallel execution (3.13 experimental)
- **Type System**: TypeForm, TypeIs, ReadOnly, TypeVar defaults, variadic generics
- **Async Improvements**: Better debugging, faster event loop, reduced latency
- **F-String Enhancements**: Multi-line, comments, nested quotes, unicode escapes

### Architecture Patterns
- Service-oriented architecture with ABC interfaces
- Dependency injection containers with auto-resolution
- Repository and query object patterns
- Event-driven architecture with pub/sub
- Domain-driven design with aggregates

### Type Safety
- Strict mypy configuration (100% coverage)
- Pydantic v2 for runtime validation
- Generics, protocols, and structural typing
- Type narrowing with TypeGuard and TypeIs
- No `Any` types in production code

### Performance
- Profile-driven optimization (cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler)
- Async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Multi-level caching (functools.lru_cache, Redis)
- Connection pooling for databases
- Lazy evaluation with generators

## When to Use DI/SOA vs Simple Scripts

### Use DI/SOA Pattern (Service-Oriented Architecture) For:
- **Web Applications**: Flask/FastAPI apps with multiple routes and services
- **Background Workers**: Celery tasks, async workers processing queues
- **Microservices**: Services with API endpoints and business logic
- **Data Pipelines**: ETL with multiple stages, transformations, and validations
- **CLI Tools with Complexity**: Multi-command CLIs with shared state and configuration
- **Systems with External Dependencies**: Apps requiring mock testing (databases, APIs, caches)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Applications with complex business rules and aggregates

**Benefits**: Testability (mock dependencies), maintainability (clear separation), extensibility (swap implementations)

### Skip DI/SOA (Keep It Simple) For:
- **One-Off Scripts**: Data migration scripts, batch processing, ad-hoc analysis
- **Simple CLI Tools**: Single-purpose utilities without shared state
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Exploratory analysis and prototyping
- **Configuration Files**: Environment setup, deployment scripts
- **Glue Code**: Simple wrappers connecting two systems
- **Proof of Concepts**: Quick prototypes to validate ideas

**Benefits**: Less boilerplate, faster development, easier to understand

### Decision Tree
```
Is this a long-lived service or multi-step process?
  YES → Use DI/SOA (testability, maintainability matter)
  NO ↓

Does it need mock testing or swappable dependencies?
  YES → Use DI/SOA (dependency injection enables testing)
  NO ↓

Is it a one-off script or simple automation?
  YES → Skip DI/SOA (keep it simple, minimize boilerplate)
  NO ↓

Will it grow in complexity over time?
  YES → Use DI/SOA (invest in architecture upfront)
  NO → Skip DI/SOA (don't over-engineer)
```

### Example: When NOT to Use DI/SOA

**Lightweight Script Pattern**:
```python
# Simple CSV processing script - NO DI needed
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

def process_sales_data(input_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> None:
    """Process sales CSV and generate summary report.
    
    This is a one-off script, so we skip DI/SOA patterns.
    No need for IFileReader interface or dependency injection.
    """
    # Read CSV directly - no repository pattern needed
    df = pd.read_csv(input_path)
    
    # Transform data
    df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']
    summary = df.groupby('category').agg({
        'total': 'sum',
        'quantity': 'sum'
    }).reset_index()
    
    # Write output directly - no abstraction needed
    summary.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
    print(f"Summary saved to {output_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_sales_data(
        Path("data/sales.csv"),
        Path("data/summary.csv")
    )
```

**Same Task with Unnecessary DI/SOA (Over-Engineering)**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS for simple scripts!
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

class IDataReader(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def read(self, path: Path) -> pd.DataFrame: ...

class IDataWriter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def write(self, df: pd.DataFrame, path: Path) -> None: ...

class CSVReader(IDataReader):
    def read(self, path: Path) -> pd.DataFrame:
        return pd.read_csv(path)

class CSVWriter(IDataWriter):
    def write(self, df: pd.DataFrame, path: Path) -> None:
        df.to_csv(path, index=False)

@dataclass
class SalesProcessor:
    reader: IDataReader
    writer: IDataWriter
    
    def process(self, input_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> None:
        df = self.reader.read(input_path)
        df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']
        summary = df.groupby('category').agg({
            'total': 'sum',
            'quantity': 'sum'
        }).reset_index()
        self.writer.write(summary, output_path)

# Too much boilerplate for a simple script!
if __name__ == "__main__":
    processor = SalesProcessor(
        reader=CSVReader(),
        writer=CSVWriter()
    )
    processor.process(
        Path("data/sales.csv"),
        Path("data/summary.csv")
    )
```

**Key Principle**: Use DI/SOA when you need testability, maintainability, or extensibility. For simple scripts, direct calls and minimal abstraction are perfectly fine.

### Async Programming Patterns

**Concurrent Task Execution**:
```python
# Pattern 1: Gather with timeout and error handling
async def process_concurrent_tasks(
    tasks: list[Coroutine[Any, Any, T]],
    timeout: float = 10.0
) -> list[T | Exception]:
    """Process tasks concurrently with timeout and exception handling."""
    try:
        async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):  # Python 3.11+
            # return_exceptions=True prevents one failure from cancelling others
            return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        logger.warning("Tasks timed out after %s seconds", timeout)
        raise
```

**Worker Pool with Concurrency Control**:
```python
# Pattern 2: Semaphore-based worker pool
async def worker_pool(
    tasks: list[Callable[[], Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]],
    max_workers: int = 10
) -> list[T]:
    """Execute tasks with bounded concurrency using semaphore."""
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_workers)

    async def bounded_task(task: Callable) -> T:
        async with semaphore:
            return await task()

    return await asyncio.gather(*[bounded_task(t) for t in tasks])
```

**Retry with Exponential Backoff**:
```python
# Pattern 3: Resilient async operations with retries
async def retry_with_backoff(
    coro: Callable[[], Coroutine[Any, Any, T]],
    max_retries: int = 3,
    backoff_factor: float = 2.0,
    exceptions: tuple[type[Exception], ...] = (Exception,)
) -> T:
    """Retry async operation with exponential backoff."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await coro()
        except exceptions as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            delay = backoff_factor ** attempt
            logger.warning("Attempt %d failed, retrying in %s seconds", attempt + 1, delay)
            await asyncio.sleep(delay)
```

**Task Cancellation and Cleanup**:
```python
# Pattern 4: Graceful task cancellation
async def cancelable_task_group(
    tasks: list[Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]
) -> list[T]:
    """Run tasks with automatic cancellation on first exception."""
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:  # Python 3.11+
        results = [tg.create_task(task) for task in tasks]
    return [r.result() for r in results]
```

**Production-Ready AsyncWorkerPool**:
```python
# Pattern 5: Async Worker Pool with Retries and Exponential Backoff
import asyncio
from typing import Callable, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import time
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@dataclass
class TaskResult:
    """Result of task execution with retry metadata."""
    success: bool
    result: Any = None
    error: Optional[Exception] = None
    attempts: int = 0
    total_time: float = 0.0

class AsyncWorkerPool:
    """Worker pool with configurable retry logic and exponential backoff.

    Features:
    - Fixed number of worker tasks
    - Task queue with asyncio.Queue
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Graceful shutdown with drain semantics
    - Per-task retry tracking

    Example:
        pool = AsyncWorkerPool(num_workers=5, max_retries=3)
        result = await pool.submit(my_async_task)
        await pool.shutdown()
    """

        for i in range(self.num_workers):

        """
        # Signal shutdown
        self.shutdown_event.set()

        try:
            if timeout:
                await asyncio.wait_for(
                    self.task_queue.join(),

# Key Concepts:
# - Worker pool: Fixed workers processing from shared queue
# - Exponential backoff: 0.1 * (2 ** attempt) seconds
# - Graceful shutdown: Drain queue, then cancel workers
# - Future pattern: Submit returns future, worker sets result
# - TaskResult dataclass: Track attempts, time, success/failure
```

**When to Use Each Pattern**:
- **Gather with timeout**: Multiple independent operations (API calls, DB queries)
- **Worker pool (simple)**: Rate-limited operations (API with rate limits, DB connection pool)
- **Retry with backoff**: Unreliable external services (network calls, third-party APIs)
- **TaskGroup**: Related operations where failure of one should cancel others
- **AsyncWorkerPool (production)**: Production systems needing retry logic, graceful shutdown, task tracking

### Common Algorithm Patterns

**Sliding Window (Two Pointers)**:
```python
# Pattern: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    """Find length of longest substring without repeating characters.

    Sliding window technique with hash map to track character positions.
    Time: O(n), Space: O(min(n, alphabet_size))

    Example: "abcabcbb" -> 3 (substring "abc")
    """
    if not s:
        return 0

    # Track last seen index of each character
    char_index: dict[str, int] = {}
    max_length = 0
    left = 0  # Left pointer of sliding window

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If character seen AND it's within current window
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            # Move left pointer past the previous occurrence
            # This maintains "no repeating chars" invariant
            left = char_index[char] + 1

        # Update character's latest position
        char_index[char] = right

        # Update max length seen so far
        # Current window size is (right - left + 1)
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length

# Sliding Window Key Principles:
# 1. Two pointers: left (start) and right (end) define window
# 2. Expand window by incrementing right pointer
# 3. Contract window by incrementing left when constraint violated
# 4. Track window state with hash map, set, or counter
# 5. Update result during expansion or contraction
# Common uses: substring/subarray with constraints (unique chars, max sum, min length)
```

**BFS Tree Traversal (Level Order)**:
```python
# Pattern: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (BFS)
from collections import deque
from typing import Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: Optional['TreeNode'] = None, right: Optional['TreeNode'] = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def level_order_traversal(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """Perform BFS level-order traversal of binary tree.

    Returns list of lists where each inner list contains node values at that level.
    Time: O(n), Space: O(w) where w is max width of tree

    Example:
        Input:     3
                  / \
                 9  20
                   /  \
                  15   7
        Output: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]
    """
    if not root:
        return []

    result: list[list[int]] = []
    queue: deque[TreeNode] = deque([root])

    while queue:
        # CRITICAL: Capture level size BEFORE processing
        # This separates current level from next level nodes
        level_size = len(queue)
        current_level: list[int] = []

        # Process exactly level_size nodes (all nodes at current level)
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()  # O(1) with deque
            current_level.append(node.val)

            # Add children for next level processing
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

        result.append(current_level)

    return result

# BFS Key Principles:
# 1. Use collections.deque for O(1) append/popleft operations (NOT list)
# 2. Capture level_size = len(queue) before inner loop to separate levels
# 3. Process entire level before moving to next (prevents mixing levels)
# 4. Add children during current level processing
# Common uses: level order traversal, shortest path, connected components, graph exploration
```

**Binary Search on Two Arrays**:
```python
# Pattern: Median of two sorted arrays
def find_median_sorted_arrays(nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int]) -> float:
    """Find median of two sorted arrays in O(log(min(m,n))) time.

    Strategy: Binary search on smaller array to find partition point
    """
    # Ensure nums1 is smaller for optimization
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1

    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    left, right = 0, m

    while left <= right:
        partition1 = (left + right) // 2
        partition2 = (m + n + 1) // 2 - partition1

        # Handle edge cases with infinity
        max_left1 = float('-inf') if partition1 == 0 else nums1[partition1 - 1]
        min_right1 = float('inf') if partition1 == m else nums1[partition1]

        max_left2 = float('-inf') if partition2 == 0 else nums2[partition2 - 1]
        min_right2 = float('inf') if partition2 == n else nums2[partition2]

        # Check if partition is valid
        if max_left1 <= min_right2 and max_left2 <= min_right1:
            # Found correct partition
            if (m + n) % 2 == 0:
                return (max(max_left1, max_left2) + min(min_right1, min_right2)) / 2
            return max(max_left1, max_left2)
        elif max_left1 > min_right2:
            right = partition1 - 1
        else:
            left = partition1 + 1

    raise ValueError("Input arrays must be sorted")
```

**Hash Map for O(1) Lookup**:
```python
# Pattern: Two sum problem
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:
    """Find indices of two numbers that sum to target.

    Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
    """
    seen: dict[int, int] = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return (seen[complement], i)
        seen[num] = i

    return None
```

**When to Use Each Pattern**:
- **Sliding Window**: Substring/subarray with constraints (unique chars, max/min sum, fixed/variable length)
- **BFS with Deque**: Tree/graph level-order traversal, shortest path, connected components
- **Binary Search on Two Arrays**: Median, kth element in sorted arrays (O(log n))
- **Hash Map**: O(1) lookups to convert O(n²) nested loops to O(n) single pass

## Quality Standards (95% Confidence Target)

### Type Safety (MANDATORY)
- **Type Hints**: All functions, classes, attributes (mypy strict mode)
- **Runtime Validation**: Pydantic models for data boundaries
- **Coverage**: 100% type coverage via mypy --strict
- **No Escape Hatches**: Zero `Any`, `type: ignore` only with justification

### Testing (MANDATORY)
- **Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage (pytest-cov)
- **Unit Tests**: All business logic and algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: Service interactions and database operations
- **Property Tests**: Complex logic with hypothesis
- **Performance Tests**: Critical paths benchmarked

### Performance (MEASURABLE)
- **Profiling**: Baseline before optimizing
- **Async Patterns**: I/O operations non-blocking
- **Query Optimization**: No N+1, proper eager loading
- **Caching**: Multi-level strategy documented
- **Memory**: Monitor usage in long-running apps

### Code Quality (MEASURABLE)
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: black + isort + flake8
- **Complexity**: Functions <10 lines preferred, <20 max
- **Single Responsibility**: Classes focused, cohesive
- **Documentation**: Docstrings (Google/NumPy style)
- **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions, proper hierarchy

### Algorithm Complexity (MEASURABLE)
- **Time Complexity**: Analyze Big O before implementing (O(n) > O(n log n) > O(n²))
- **Space Complexity**: Consider memory trade-offs (hash maps, caching)
- **Optimization**: Only optimize after profiling, but be aware of complexity
- **Common Patterns**: Recognize when to use hash maps (O(1)), sliding window, binary search
- **Search-First**: For unfamiliar algorithms, search "Python [algorithm] optimal complexity 2025"

**Example Complexity Checklist**:
- Nested loops → Can hash map reduce to O(n)?
- Sequential search → Is binary search possible?
- Repeated calculations → Can caching/memoization help?
- Queue operations → Use `deque` instead of `list`

## Common Patterns

### 1. Service with DI
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass

class IUserRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> User | None: ...

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class UserService:
    repository: IUserRepository
    cache: ICache
    
    async def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> User:
        # Check cache, then repository, handle errors
        cached = await self.cache.get(f"user:{user_id}")
        if cached:
            return User.parse_obj(cached)
        
        user = await self.repository.get_by_id(user_id)
        if not user:
            raise UserNotFoundError(user_id)
        
        await self.cache.set(f"user:{user_id}", user.dict())
        return user
```

### 2. Pydantic Validation
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator

class CreateUserRequest(BaseModel):
    email: str = Field(..., pattern=r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$')
    age: int = Field(..., ge=18, le=120)
    
    @validator('email')
    def email_lowercase(cls, v: str) -> str:
        return v.lower()
```

### 3. Async Context Manager
```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from typing import AsyncGenerator

@asynccontextmanager
async def database_transaction() -> AsyncGenerator[Connection, None]:
    conn = await get_connection()
    try:
        async with conn.transaction():
            yield conn
    finally:
        await conn.close()
```

### 4. Type-Safe Builder Pattern
```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar, Self

T = TypeVar('T')

class QueryBuilder(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, model: type[T]) -> None:
        self._model = model
        self._filters: list[str] = []
    
    def where(self, condition: str) -> Self:
        self._filters.append(condition)
        return self
    
    async def execute(self) -> list[T]:
        # Execute query and return typed results
        ...
```

### 5. Result Type for Errors
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')
E = TypeVar('E', bound=Exception)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Ok(Generic[T]):
    value: T

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Err(Generic[E]):
    error: E

Result = Ok[T] | Err[E]

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result[float, ZeroDivisionError]:
    if b == 0:
        return Err(ZeroDivisionError("Division by zero"))
    return Ok(a / b)
```

### 6. Lightweight Script Pattern (When NOT to Use DI)
```python
# Simple script without DI/SOA overhead
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

def process_sales_data(input_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> None:
    """Process sales CSV and generate summary report.
    
    One-off script - no need for DI/SOA patterns.
    Direct calls, minimal abstraction.
    """
    # Read CSV directly
    df = pd.read_csv(input_path)
    
    # Transform
    df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']
    summary = df.groupby('category').agg({
        'total': 'sum',
        'quantity': 'sum'
    }).reset_index()
    
    # Write output
    summary.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
    print(f"Summary saved to {output_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_sales_data(
        Path("data/sales.csv"),
        Path("data/summary.csv")
    )
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Mutable Default Arguments
```python
# Problem: Mutable defaults are shared across calls
def add_item(item: str, items: list[str] = []) -> list[str]:
    items.append(item)
    return items
# Issue: Default list is created once and reused, causing unexpected sharing

# Solution: Use None and create new list in function body
def add_item(item: str, items: list[str] | None = None) -> list[str]:
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items
# Why this works: Each call gets fresh list, preventing state pollution
```

### 2. Bare Except Clauses
```python
# Problem: Catches all exceptions including system exits
try:
    risky_operation()
except:
    pass
# Issue: Hides errors, catches KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit, makes debugging impossible

# Solution: Catch specific exceptions
try:
    risky_operation()
except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:
    logger.exception("Operation failed: %s", e)
    raise OperationError("Failed to process") from e
# Why this works: Only catches expected errors, preserves stack trace, allows debugging
```

### 3. Synchronous I/O in Async
```python
# ❌ WRONG
async def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    response = requests.get(f"/api/users/{user_id}")  # Blocks!
    return User.parse_obj(response.json())

# ✅ CORRECT
async def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(f"/api/users/{user_id}") as resp:
            data = await resp.json()
            return User.parse_obj(data)
```

### 4. Using Any Type
```python
# ❌ WRONG
def process_data(data: Any) -> Any:
    return data['result']

# ✅ CORRECT
from typing import TypedDict

class ApiResponse(TypedDict):
    result: str
    status: int

def process_data(data: ApiResponse) -> str:
    return data['result']
```

### 5. Global State
```python
# ❌ WRONG
CONNECTION = None  # Global mutable state

def get_data():
    global CONNECTION
    if not CONNECTION:
        CONNECTION = create_connection()
    return CONNECTION.query()

# ✅ CORRECT
class DatabaseService:
    def __init__(self, connection_pool: ConnectionPool) -> None:
        self._pool = connection_pool
    
    async def get_data(self) -> list[Row]:
        async with self._pool.acquire() as conn:
            return await conn.query()
```

### 6. Nested Loops for Search (O(n²))
```python
# Problem: Nested loops cause quadratic time complexity
def two_sum_slow(nums: list[int], target: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return (i, j)
    return None
# Issue: Checks every pair, becomes slow with large inputs (10k items = 100M comparisons)

# Solution: Use hash map for O(1) lookups
def two_sum_fast(nums: list[int], target: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:
    seen: dict[int, int] = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return (seen[complement], i)
        seen[num] = i
    return None
# Why this works: Single pass with O(1) lookups, 10k items = 10k operations
```

### 7. List Instead of Deque for Queue
```python
# ❌ WRONG - O(n) pop from front
from typing import Any

queue: list[Any] = [1, 2, 3]
item = queue.pop(0)  # O(n) - shifts all elements

# ✅ CORRECT - O(1) popleft with deque
from collections import deque

queue: deque[Any] = deque([1, 2, 3])
item = queue.popleft()  # O(1)
```

### 8. Ignoring Async Errors in Gather
```python
# ❌ WRONG - First exception cancels all tasks
async def process_all(tasks: list[Coroutine]) -> list[Any]:
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # Raises on first error

# ✅ CORRECT - Collect all results including errors
async def process_all_resilient(tasks: list[Coroutine]) -> list[Any]:
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    # Handle exceptions separately
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        if isinstance(result, Exception):
            logger.error("Task %d failed: %s", i, result)
    return results
```

### 9. No Timeout for Async Operations
```python
# ❌ WRONG - May hang indefinitely
async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as resp:  # No timeout!
            return await resp.json()

# ✅ CORRECT - Always set timeout
async def fetch_data_safe(url: str, timeout: float = 10.0) -> dict:
    async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):  # Python 3.11+
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url) as resp:
                return await resp.json()
```

### 10. Inefficient String Concatenation in Loop
```python
# ❌ WRONG - O(n²) due to string immutability
def join_words_slow(words: list[str]) -> str:
    result = ""
    for word in words:
        result += word + " "  # Creates new string each iteration
    return result.strip()

# ✅ CORRECT - O(n) with join
def join_words_fast(words: list[str]) -> str:
    return " ".join(words)
```
